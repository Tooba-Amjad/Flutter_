# Task Management System (Project Proposal)

## Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a fully functional **task management application** using **Flutter** and **Firebase**. The application will enable users to effectively manage their daily tasks through features like task addition, modification, deletion, categorization, and custom notifications.

## Project Description
This project involves creating a task management application that not only handles basic task management but also includes advanced functionality such as:
- Task repetition.
- Progress tracking.
- Data export options.

The application will provide:
- A **user-friendly interface**.
- Robust **cloud-based storage** using Firebase.
- Various **customization capabilities**.

### 5. Notifications
- Implement **Firebase Cloud Messaging** or local notifications to alert users of upcoming tasks based on their due dates and times.

### 6. Testing
- Conduct thorough testing for **functionality**, **usability**, and **responsiveness**.
- Identify and resolve any bugs or issues.

### 7. Documentation and Submission on GitHub
- Submit:
  - Complete source code.
  - **.apk** file.
  - Any necessary configuration files.
- Include a **video demonstration** of the application.
